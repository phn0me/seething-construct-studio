# Seething Construct Studio

Welcome to Seething Construct Studio. We craft dark, gritty, and immersive 2D top-down games with arcane themes. Our current project, *Smith's Awakening*, invites players to restore the lost power of a corrupted golem, Sinth. Join us as we create worlds where every choice matters and every item holds power.
