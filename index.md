# Welcome to Seething Construct Studio

We are an indie game studio specializing in dark, gritty, and arcane 2D top-down games.

Our current project, *Smith's Awakening*, immerses you in a world where you are the caretaker of Sinth, a golem corrupted by an unknown force. Venture into biomes, cleanse corrupted constructs, and restore the power of the golem as you craft weapons and equip heroes to fight against the forces of evil.

Stay tuned for updates on our upcoming games!
