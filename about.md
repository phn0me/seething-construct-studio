# About Seething Construct Studio

Seething Construct Studio is a small indie team focused on creating games with dark fantasy themes. Our vision is to craft immersive, atmospheric worlds filled with arcane magic, ancient constructs, and gripping narratives.

Our debut project, *Smith's Awakening*, follows the journey of a caretaker bound to a corrupted golem, Sinth. As you explore biomes, gather resources, and cleanse constructs, you will unlock powerful crafting abilities to help save the world.

We draw inspiration from games like *Zelda: A Link to the Past*, *Moonlighter*, *Darkest Dungeon*, and *Baldurâ€™s Gate 2*.

Join us on this dark journey, and stay updated on our latest news and developments.
